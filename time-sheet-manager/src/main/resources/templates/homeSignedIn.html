                        From humble beginnings in Cardiff - Admiral launched with just 57 staff members and no customers - to offices in seven countries and more than 7,000 staff and four million customers, it's fair to say Admiral has changed over the years.</p>
                    <p class="messaging">
                        But the one thing that hasn’t changed is our ethos: “People who like what they do, do it better.” Admiral’s founder, Henry Engelhard, said that, and we truly believe happy staff work harder, give better customer service and are happy to go above and beyond to do the best by our policyholders.
